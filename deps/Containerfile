# This Containerfile exists to package dependencies for kubesan, so that
# building the kubesan container can pull in pre-built dependencies rather
# than having to spend the time rebuilding them every time.  The containers
# produced by this file are public at quay.io/kubesan/, but are only useful
# for copying files from the pre-built cache over to another container,
# and not something you would ever execute on its own.

## --target kubesan-tools
